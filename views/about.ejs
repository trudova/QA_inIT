 <p class="text-dark">In the questions session you can find all the questions people got at their interview. They ma had an answer or not. If not, you can offer your answer to that question. And post it  in the comments.</p>
 <p class="text-dark">In the new question section, you can submit your question. If during the interview you didnâ€™t come up with any answer, simply put NEED HELP in the answer input, and others will help you.
All people can see the questions, answers and comments, however, only those who registered can submit their own questions and comments, as well as delete and update them.
